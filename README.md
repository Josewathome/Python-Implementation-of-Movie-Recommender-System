# Python | Implementation of Movie Recommender System
In my project, I utilized the Collaborative Filtering approach to build a model based on user behavior, specifically their movie ratings. The model identifies correlations between different movies based on these ratings, which can then be used to recommend similar movies to users. This is a quintessential example of user-user collaborative filtering, where recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users. Unlike content-based filtering, which would involve using specific attributes of the movies themselves (like genre, director, actors, etc.) to make recommendations, my approach focused solely on user behavior.
